# ADR-0001: Layered Architecture & Contract-first
Status: Proposed | Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Context: Need robust semi-automation with reproducibility and safety.
Decision: UI→App→Domain(Ports)→Infra(Adapters); Contract-first for DSL and ports.
Consequences: Clear boundaries, independent contract tests, easier rollback.
